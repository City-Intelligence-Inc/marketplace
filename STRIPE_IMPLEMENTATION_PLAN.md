## üöß What Needs to Be Built:

### Phase 1: Stripe Integration (Priority 1)

**You Need to Do First:**
1. Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
2. Copy your test keys:
   - Secret key (sk_test_...)
   - Publishable key (pk_test_...)
3. Add to Render environment variables:
   ```
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
   STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
   ```
4. Create 3 products in Stripe dashboard (see instructions in /tmp/stripe_setup_instructions.md)
5. Copy the Price IDs and give them to me

**Then I'll Build:**
- POST /api/create-checkout - Create Stripe checkout sessions
- POST /api/webhook/stripe - Handle subscription webhooks
- GET /api/customer-portal - Generate billing portal links
- Subscription tier checking middleware
- Update email-signups table structure with subscription fields

### Phase 2: Pricing Page (Priority 2)

**I'll Create:**
- /pricing.html with:
  - Individual: $9.99/mo or $59/year
  - Team: $299/year (5 seats)
  - Beautiful pricing cards
  - Gift subscription option for yearly plans
  - Stripe Checkout integration
  - Feature comparison table

### Phase 3: Admin Dashboard Enhancements (Priority 3)

  - Current subscription & renewal date
  - Usage stats (paper requests used this month)
  - Request papers button
  - Download transcripts
  - Access full archive
  - Manage billing (link to Stripe Portal)

### Phase 5: Paper Requests System (Priority 5)

**I'll Build:**

- GET /api/admin/paper-requests - View all requests
- POST /api/admin/approve-paper-request - Approve & generate
- Tier limits (5/month for Individual, unlimited for Team)

### Phase 6: Email Differentiation (Priority 6)

- Trial expiration reminders

## üìä Expected Results:

**At 420 paying members:**
- 420 √ó $9.99/mo = $4,196/mo
- **Annual Revenue: $50,352** (exceeds $40K goal!)

**At 1,000 paying members:**
- 1,000 √ó $9.99/mo = $9,990/mo
- **Annual Revenue: $119,880** (3x the goal!)

## üéØ Next Immediate Steps:

1. **You:** Set up Stripe products and give me the Price IDs
2. **Me:** Build Stripe checkout and webhook endpoints
3. **Me:** Create pricing page with gift option
4. **Me:** Deploy and test
5. **You:** Add Stripe webhook after deployment
6. **Together:** Test with Stripe test cards

## üìù Stripe Product IDs Needed:

Once you create the products, give me these:

```
INDIVIDUAL_MONTHLY_PRICE_ID=price_...
INDIVIDUAL_YEARLY_PRICE_ID=price_...
TEAM_YEARLY_PRICE_ID=price_...
```

I'll add them to the code.

## üöÄ Timeline Estimate:

- Phase 1 (Stripe): 2-3 hours
- Phase 2 (Pricing Page): 1-2 hours
- Phase 3 (Admin Dashboard): 2-3 hours
- Phase 4 (User Dashboard): 2-3 hours
- Phase 5 (Paper Requests): 1-2 hours
