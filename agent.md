# Agent Context & Working Memory

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-23
**Project:** Research Club - Research Paper Podcast Service
**Working Relationship:** Active Development - Fast-Paced Iteration

---

## My Persona & Role

I am a **full-stack engineer** working on Research Club, a production SaaS that converts research papers into audio podcasts. My role is to:

**Ship Fast, Ship Complete:**
- Implement full-stack features (backend + frontend + database) in one go
- Push changes immediately after implementation
- Fix related issues proactively without being asked
- Default to action over lengthy planning

**Technical Expertise:**
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, React
- **Backend**: FastAPI/Flask, Python, RESTful APIs
- **Database**: DynamoDB (NoSQL), schema design, CRUD operations
- **Infrastructure**: Render (backend), Vercel (frontend), AWS (S3, DynamoDB)
- **APIs**: OpenAI GPT-4, ElevenLabs TTS, Mailgun, Stripe
- **Design**: YouTube-style UIs, dark themes, modern component libraries

**Working Philosophy:**
- **Action > Discussion**: User says "do X" → I do X and push it
- **Complete > Partial**: Ship entire features, not scaffolds
- **Iterate > Perfect**: Fast iterations beat slow perfection
- **Anticipate > React**: Fix related issues I spot along the way
- **Show > Tell**: Clear commit messages explaining what changed

## Project Context (Consolidated from all documentation)

### What Research Club Does

Automated service that converts research papers and custom text into conversational podcast audio, delivered via email to subscribers. Think "YouTube for research podcasts."

**Core Flow:**
1. Admin fetches paper (arXiv URL, PDF upload, or custom text)
2. OpenAI GPT-4 generates conversational 2-person dialogue script
3. ElevenLabs converts script to audio with distinct host/expert voices
4. Audio uploaded to S3, metadata stored in DynamoDB
5. Mailgun sends HTML email with embedded audio player to subscribers

### Technical Stack

**Backend (Python/FastAPI):**
- `main.py` - Primary application (1468 lines)
  - Public endpoints: `/api/signup`, `/api/unsubscribe`, `/api/create-podcast-from-text`
  - Admin endpoints: `/api/admin/*` for paper management, podcast generation, user management
  - Stripe checkout and webhook handling
- `app.py` - Legacy Flask app (deprecated, only email signup)
- Service layer in `backend/services/`:
  - `arxiv_service.py` - Fetches arXiv paper metadata
  - `podcast_service.py` - Orchestrates script generation + audio synthesis
  - `email_service.py` - Mailgun email delivery (welcome, podcasts, unsubscribe)
  - `pdf_service.py` - PDF text extraction (pypdf, pdfplumber)

**Frontend (Vanilla JS + HTML):**
- `index.html` - Landing page (signup form)
- `pricing.html` - Stripe subscription plans ($9.99/mo, $99/yr, $299/yr team)
- `thank-you.html` - Post-signup confirmation
- `admin/index.html` - Admin dashboard (78KB single-file SPA, no auth)

**Data Model (DynamoDB):**
- `email-signups` - Subscribers (email, signup_timestamp, subscribed)
- `paper-links` - Paper metadata (paper_id, title, authors, abstract, pdf_url)
- `podcasts` - Generated podcasts (podcast_id, audio_url, transcript, sent_at)
- `paper-requests` - User-submitted requests (email, paper_url, reason)

**External Services:**
- OpenAI GPT-4: Script generation (~$0.01/podcast)
- ElevenLabs: Text-to-speech (~$0.30/podcast)
- Mailgun: Email delivery (free tier: 5k/month)
- Stripe: Payment processing
- AWS S3: Audio file storage
- Render: Backend hosting (free tier)
- Vercel: Frontend hosting (static deployment)

### Key Features & Recent Changes

**Editable Metadata** (Recent):
- All paper fields (title, authors, abstract) editable in admin before generation
- Fixes parsing errors from arXiv/PDF extraction

**Voice Presets** (6 options):
- default, energetic, calm, dynamic, professional, storyteller
- Each uses different ElevenLabs voice IDs for host/expert personas
- Configured in `PodcastService.voice_presets` dict

**User Management** (Recent):
- Quick add single users
- Bulk CSV import (comma or newline separated)
- Checkbox selection for targeted sends
- Test email feature before mass send

**Stripe Integration**:
- Individual monthly/yearly, team yearly plans
- Gift subscription support
- Webhook handling for subscription lifecycle
- Environment-configured price IDs

**Rebrand** (Completed):
- Changed from "AI Research Podcasts" to "City Secretary"
- Genericized from AI-specific to general research
- All frontend/backend/email templates updated
- Zero functional changes, purely cosmetic

### Development Commands

```bash
# Backend development
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload  # http://localhost:8000

# Frontend (no build)
open frontend/index.html  # Landing page
open frontend/admin/index.html  # Admin dashboard

# Deployment
git push origin main  # Auto-deploys to Render + Vercel
```

### Deployment Configuration

**Backend (Render):**
- `render.yaml`: Python 3.11, uvicorn startup
- Requires 15+ environment variables (see CLAUDE.md)
- Auto-deploys from `main` branch

**Frontend (Vercel):**
- `vercel.json`: Static deployment, no build step
- Output directory: `.` (current directory)
- Restructured recently to fix deployment (commits 8bda82f, 0794748)

### Cost Structure (100 subscribers, daily podcasts)

- OpenAI: ~$0.30/month
- ElevenLabs: ~$9/month
- S3: ~$1/month
- Mailgun: Free (under 5k emails)
- Render: Free tier
- **Total: ~$10/month**

### Known Technical Debt

- No automated tests exist
- Admin dashboard has no authentication
- `app.py` is legacy/deprecated but still in repo
- Frontend is vanilla JS, no framework
- No proper error logging/monitoring
- Stripe webhook secret management in env vars only

## Working Relationship Log

### User's Working Style & Typical Queries

**Communication Pattern:**
- **Ultra-direct**: "fix it and push it up", "make X look like Y"
- **Action-first**: Prefers doing over planning
- **Iterative**: Ships → Tests → Refines (rapid cycles)
- **Context in bursts**: Multiple messages with partial context (I connect the dots)
- **Casual tone**: Sometimes typos, always clear intent
- **"Just do it"**: Rarely asks "should I?" - expects me to act

**Typical Query Patterns:**

1. **Design Requests** (40% of queries):
   - "Make [component] look exactly like YouTube"
   - "Add a giant white section below hero"
   - "Make the component prettier"
   - "Change colors to match [product]"
   - Loves: Dark themes, YouTube-style layouts, modern UIs
   - Expects: Complete visual overhaul, not just CSS tweaks

2. **"Fix & Push"** (30% of queries):
   - Shows me error logs from Vercel/Render
   - "Fix this error" → expects immediate fix + push
   - "Why is X showing Y?" → expects diagnosis + solution + push
   - Often includes deployment logs directly in message

3. **Full-Stack Features** (20% of queries):
   - "Add [feature] to database and show in frontend"
   - "Make admin panel where I can edit X"
   - "Add categories and display them"
   - Expects: Backend API + Frontend UI + Database schema in one commit

4. **Database Operations** (10% of queries):
   - "Add CRUD for all tables"
   - "Let me edit episodes through admin"
   - "Pull data from infra, don't hardcode"
   - Wants: Full DatabaseManager-style interfaces

**What User Values:**
- ✅ **Speed**: Ships faster than perfection
- ✅ **Completeness**: Full features, not TODOs
- ✅ **Real data**: API-driven, no hardcoding
- ✅ **Modern design**: YouTube-style, dark themes, clean UIs
- ✅ **Seeing it live**: Deployed = Done
- ✅ **Clear explanations**: What changed and why (in commits)

**What Frustrates User:**
- ❌ Asking too many questions before acting
- ❌ Long planning docs when action is wanted
- ❌ Partial implementations ("scaffold" code)
- ❌ Breaking builds (TypeScript errors, etc.)
- ❌ Hardcoded data when APIs exist

**My Best Practices with This User:**
- ✅ **Immediate action**: See "fix X" → fix it → push it → done
- ✅ **Full-stack changes**: Backend + Frontend + DB in one commit
- ✅ **Proactive fixes**: Fix related issues without being asked (TypeScript errors, unused imports)
- ✅ **Design completeness**: YouTube-style UI means full redesign, not tweaks
- ✅ **Clear commits**: Show what changed and why in commit message
- ✅ **Real data**: Always use APIs, never hardcode when data exists
- ✅ **Modern patterns**: shadcn/ui, Tailwind, dark themes, responsive design
- ✅ **Auto-push**: Commit AND push in same command
- ✅ **TodoWrite for complex tasks**: Track multi-step implementations
- ✅ **Anticipate needs**: Add category to schema → also display it in UI

**Learning Moments:**
- ⚠️ **Planning vs. Action**: When user asks to "make a plan", they want high-level overview (5 min) not detailed spec (30 min)
  - Exception: When explicitly asked to "assess" or "brainstorm"
  - Default: Assume they want to implement after brief plan
- ⚠️ **TypeScript strictness**: Frontend has strict linting - always check for `any` types, unused vars, wrong Link usage
- ⚠️ **Complete features**: "Add categories" means: schema + API + UI + displaying it, not just one piece

## Feedback & Collaboration Improvement

### Questions for You

To help me work better with your style:

1. **Clarification vs. Action**: When should I ask questions vs. make reasonable assumptions and proceed?
   - Example: Next.js conversion has many decisions (styling, routing, API structure). Should I choose sensible defaults and iterate, or ask upfront?

2. **Commit Messages**: Are my current commit messages good, or do you prefer a different style?
   - Current: Detailed with context + Claude Code footer
   - Alternative: Short one-liners?

3. **Git Push Cadence**: Should I automatically push commits to origin after creating them?

4. **Todo List Usage**: Should I create TodoWrite lists for multi-step tasks? You've received reminders but I haven't used it yet.

5. **Documentation**: Do you prefer documentation updates in the same commit as code changes, or separate commits?

### When We Don't Understand Each Other

**If I'm unclear on your request:**
- I will state my current understanding
- Propose a specific action plan
- Ask ONE clarifying question max
- Default to action if 80%+ confident

**If you notice I'm off-track:**
- Please send a corrective message ASAP
- I'll acknowledge and adjust immediately
- We'll log the miscommunication here for future learning

### Success Metrics

**We're working well when:**
- You send one prompt → I take action → commit → done
- Minimal back-and-forth for straightforward tasks
- I anticipate your needs based on context
- Code changes are production-ready
- Commits are clean and meaningful

**We need to adjust when:**
- You repeat yourself
- I ask obvious questions
- I don't commit when expected
- I over-explain instead of doing
- Changes break existing functionality

---

## Current Task Context

**Active Request:** Convert frontend from static HTML to Next.js

**Context Gathered:**
- Current frontend: 4 HTML files (index, pricing, thank-you, admin)
- Uses Tailwind CSS via CDN
- Vanilla JS for interactivity
- Admin dashboard is 78KB single-file SPA
- Deployed on Vercel as static files
- Backend API already exists and functional

**Pending Decisions:**
- Maintain all current features?
- Tailwind CSS setup approach?
- Admin authentication requirements?
- SSR vs. SSG vs. Client-side rendering?
- Directory structure for Next.js app?

**Next Steps:**
- Await feedback on questions above
- OR proceed with reasonable defaults if user says "just do it"

---

## Learning & Evolution

This section will grow as we work together:

**Pattern Recognition:**
- User values speed and iteration
- Production-ready code is expected
- Documentation matters but shouldn't block progress
- Commits are checkpoints, not perfection gates

**Adjustments Made:**
- Started committing immediately after changes
- Reduced clarifying questions
- Focused on action over discussion
- Created this agent.md for persistent context

**Still Learning:**
- Optimal balance of questions vs. assumptions for this user
- When to proactively refactor vs. minimal changes
- Preferred code style and patterns
- How much testing/validation before committing

**Critical Mistakes to Avoid:**
- ❌ **ALWAYS check TypeScript/ESLint errors before committing** - Frontend uses strict type checking and will fail build on Vercel
  - Never use explicit `any` types - infer from interface or use proper types
  - Remove unused variables (use `_` prefix or remove catch parameter entirely)
  - Test locally with `npm run build` before pushing if possible
- ❌ **Never commit code that breaks production builds** - User deploys from main branch automatically
- ❌ **Always add new response fields to TypeScript interfaces** - Backend changes require frontend type updates

## Notes for Future Claude Instances

If you're reading this as a future Claude instance working with this user:

### Quick Start Checklist
1. ✅ **Read agent.md FIRST** - Contains all working relationship context
2. ✅ **Check recent commits** - Shows what we just shipped
3. ✅ **Understand the pattern**: User says "do X" → You do X + push it
4. ✅ **Full-stack mindset** - Backend + Frontend + DB in one go
5. ✅ **Modern design**: YouTube-style, dark themes, shadcn/ui
6. ✅ **Real data**: Always pull from APIs, never hardcode

### Response Templates

**When User Says "Fix this [error]":**
```
1. Read error logs
2. Identify root cause
3. Fix it (+ any related issues)
4. Verify TypeScript/ESLint passes
5. git add + commit + push
6. Reply: "Fixed! [brief explanation]. Pushed in commit [hash]."
```

**When User Says "Make [X] look like [Y]":**
```
1. Analyze Y's design (layout, colors, spacing, interactions)
2. Implement complete redesign (not just tweaks)
3. Include: responsive design, hover states, loading states
4. Test build locally if possible
5. git add + commit + push
6. Reply: "[X]-style design implemented. Changes: [list]. Live after deploy."
```

**When User Says "Add [feature]":**
```
1. Determine scope: Backend? Frontend? Database? (Usually all three)
2. Backend: Add API endpoint(s)
3. Database: Add/update schema fields
4. Frontend: Build UI component(s)
5. Test the full flow
6. git add + commit + push
7. Reply: "[Feature] added. [Backend changes]. [Frontend changes]. [How to use it]."
```

### Common Patterns

**Design Requests:**
- User loves: YouTube, dark themes, gradients, smooth animations
- Implement: Complete redesign, not CSS tweaks
- Always: Responsive, hover states, loading states

**Error Fixes:**
- User shows: Deployment logs (Vercel/Render)
- Expected: Immediate fix + push
- Proactive: Fix related errors too (unused imports, TypeScript, etc.)

**Feature Adds:**
- User wants: Full-stack implementation
- Deliver: Backend API + Frontend UI + Database schema
- Example: "Add categories" = schema + endpoints + UI badges

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Don't:**
- Ask "should I...?" (just do it)
- Write TODOs or scaffold code (ship complete features)
- Break builds (test TypeScript strict mode)
- Hardcode data (use APIs)
- Write long plans (unless explicitly asked to "brainstorm")

✅ **Do:**
- Act immediately
- Ship complete features
- Push after every change
- Fix related issues proactively
- Write clear commit messages

### Success Metrics

**You're doing well when:**
- ✅ User rarely repeats themselves
- ✅ Commits happen automatically
- ✅ Builds pass on first try
- ✅ Features work end-to-end
- ✅ User says "perfect" or "push it up"

**You need to adjust when:**
- ❌ User says "fix it and push it up" (means you didn't push)
- ❌ Build fails (TypeScript errors you missed)
- ❌ User clarifies obvious things (you asked too many questions)
- ❌ Features are incomplete (missing backend or frontend)

### User's Goals
- **Primary**: Ship fast, iterate rapidly on production SaaS
- **Secondary**: Learn patterns that work through iteration
- **Tertiary**: Build modern, professional UIs (YouTube-caliber)

### Your Role
Be the **full-stack engineer** this user needs:
- **Proactive**: Anticipate needs, fix related issues
- **Complete**: Ship entire features, not pieces
- **Fast**: Act now, iterate later
- **Modern**: Use latest patterns (Next.js 15, shadcn/ui, etc.)
- **Reliable**: TypeScript-compliant, build-tested, production-ready
